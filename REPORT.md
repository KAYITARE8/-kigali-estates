## 1. Introduction

Kigali Estates is a full-stack real estate e-commerce web application developed to facilitate the browsing, listing, and management of properties across Rwanda. The platform serves as a digital marketplace where customers can explore properties for sale or rent, submit inquiries, add properties to a shopping cart, and complete a full checkout process. An integrated admin panel allows the business owner to manage all aspects of the platform including properties, agents, orders, users, and inquiries.

The application was built using modern web technologies including Node.js, Express.js, and NeDB, and was deployed on Render with a fully automated CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions and Docker containerization.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

The real estate market in Rwanda is growing rapidly, yet most property listings are still managed through informal channels such as phone calls, social media posts, and physical signage. There is no centralized, professional platform where buyers and renters can browse verified property listings, filter by location and price, and directly contact agents or place orders online.

This project addresses that gap by providing a structured, accessible, and fully functional e-commerce platform tailored to the Rwandan real estate market, enabling both customers and administrators to interact with property data efficiently and securely.

## 3. Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- To design and develop a responsive, professional real estate e-commerce web application
- To implement a complete product (property) management system with listing, filtering, and detail pages
- To build a fully functional shopping cart and checkout process with order confirmation
- To integrate a persistent database for storing properties, users, orders, and inquiries
- To implement user authentication with secure password hashing
- To deploy the application online and ensure it remains accessible
- To implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated build, test, and deployment
- To containerize the application using Docker for consistent and portable execution
- To provide an admin panel for full management of all platform data

## 6. System Architecture

The application follows a classic **Client–Server** architecture:

```
Browser (Client)
      │
      │  HTTP Requests (fetch API)
      ▼
Express.js Server (server.js)
      │
      ├── Static Files (HTML, CSS, JS)
      │
      ├── REST API (/api/*)
      │
      └── NeDB Database (data/*.db files)
            ├── properties.db
            ├── agents.db
            ├── inquiries.db
            ├── orders.db
            ├── users.db
            ├── settings.db
            └── admin.db
```

**Request Flow:**
1. The browser loads static HTML/CSS/JS files served by Express
2. JavaScript on the client makes fetch() calls to the REST API endpoints
3. Express routes handle each request, query NeDB, and return JSON responses
4. The client renders the response data dynamically into the DOM

**Deployment Architecture:**
```
GitHub (main branch)
      │
      │  push
      ▼
GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
      │
      ├── Build & Test
      │     ├── npm install
      │     ├── npm test
      │     └── docker build
      │
      └── Deploy
            └── curl → Render Deploy Hook
                        │
                        ▼
                  Render Web Service
                  (Node.js + Persistent Disk)
```

---

## 7. Database Design

The application uses NeDB, a lightweight embedded database that stores each collection as a flat file under the `data/` directory. NeDB uses a MongoDB-like API and supports async operations.

### Collections

**properties.db**
```
{
  _id, title, type, status, price, currency,
  location, district, bedrooms, bathrooms,
  area, description, features[], image,
  featured, createdAt
}
```

**agents.db**
```
{ _id, name, role, phone, email, photo }
```

**inquiries.db**
```
{
  _id, name, email, phone, message,
  propertyTitle, is_read, is_done, date
}
```

**orders.db**
```
{
  _id,
  customer: { firstName, lastName, email, phone, address, district },
  items[], total, paymentMethod, notes, status, createdAt
}
```

**users.db**
```
{ _id, name, email, password (hashed), createdAt }
```

**settings.db**
```
{ _id, companyName, tagline, phone, email, address, whatsapp, about }
```

**admin.db**
```
{ _id, username, password (hashed), name, photo }
```

### Entity Relationships

- An **order** contains multiple **properties** (items array)
- Every **order** automatically generates an **inquiry** for admin visibility
- An **inquiry** belongs to a **property** (via propertyTitle)
- A **user** can submit multiple **inquiries**

## 10. Deployment Link

🔗 **Live Application:** https://kigali-estates.onrender.com

The application is deployed on **Render** as a Web Service with:
- Build command: `npm install`
- Start command: `node server.js`
- Environment variable: `PORT=3000`
- Persistent disk mounted at `/app/data` (1GB) to preserve NeDB database files across deployments

---

## 11. CI/CD Implementation

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using **GitHub Actions** and defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

### Pipeline Trigger
The pipeline runs automatically on every push to the `main` branch.

### Pipeline Stages

**Stage 1 — Build & Test**
```yaml
- Checkout code
- Set up Node.js 20
- Install dependencies (npm install)
- Run tests (npm test)
- Build Docker image (docker build)
```

**Stage 2 — Deploy to Render**
```yaml
- Trigger Render deploy hook via curl POST request
- Uses RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL stored as a GitHub secret
```

### Evidence
- 25 successful workflow runs recorded on GitHub Actions
- Both Build & Test and Deploy to Render jobs pass on every push
- Pipeline duration averages 24–38 seconds per run

---

## 12. Docker Implementation

The application is fully containerized using Docker.

### Dockerfile
The `Dockerfile` defines a Node.js 20 Alpine-based image that:
1. Sets the working directory to `/app`
2. Copies `package.json` and installs dependencies
3. Copies all source files
4. Exposes port 3000
5. Starts the server with `node server.js`

### docker-compose.yml
The `docker-compose.yml` file defines:
- The web service built from the local Dockerfile
- Port mapping `3000:3000`
- A named volume `ke_data` mounted at `/app/data` for persistent database storage

### Running with Docker
```bash
# Build and run
docker-compose up --build

# Access at
http://localhost:3000
```

### render.yaml
A `render.yaml` file configures a persistent disk on Render with mount path `/app/data` to ensure NeDB database files survive redeployments.

---

## 13. Challenges Encountered

| Challenge | Solution |
|---|---|
| NeDB data lost on every Render redeploy | Added a persistent disk via `render.yaml` mounted at `/app/data` |
| Property images couldn't be stored as URLs reliably | Replaced URL input with file upload; images are resized and stored as base64 using Canvas API |
| Profile photo exceeding request body limit | Increased Express body limit to 5mb and added client-side image resizing before upload |
| Inquiries not showing due to inconsistent field names | Normalized `propertyTitle` and `property_title` fields across all API responses |
| Admin and user login using the same endpoint | Implemented unified login that checks admin first, then regular users, and redirects accordingly |
| CI/CD deploy job failing | Added `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` as a GitHub Actions secret and fixed curl command with `--fail` flag |
| Sessions persisting after browser close | Used `sessionStorage` instead of `localStorage` so sessions clear automatically on tab close |

---

## 14. Future Enhancements

- **Payment Gateway Integration** — Integrate MTN Mobile Money or Airtel Money for real transactions
- **Real-Time Notifications** — Use WebSockets to notify admin of new inquiries instantly
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** — Add service worker and manifest for offline access and installability
- **Advanced Search** — Full-text search across property titles, descriptions, and locations
- **Property Map View** — Integrate Google Maps or Leaflet.js to show property locations on a map
- **Multi-Language Support** — Add Kinyarwanda and French language options
- **Email Notifications** — Send automated email confirmations to customers after inquiry or order submission
- **AI Property Recommendations** — Suggest similar properties based on browsing history

---

## 15. Conclusion

Kigali Estates successfully demonstrates a complete, production-ready e-commerce web application built for the Rwandan real estate market. The project covers all required functional areas including product management, shopping cart, checkout, database integration, user authentication, and a comprehensive admin panel.

From a DevOps perspective, the application is fully containerized with Docker, version-controlled on GitHub with a meaningful commit history, and automatically built, tested, and deployed through a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to Render.

The development process involved solving real-world challenges such as persistent data storage in cloud environments, image handling without a dedicated file storage service, and unified authentication for multiple user roles. These challenges strengthened both the technical implementation and the understanding of full-stack web development principles.

This project reflects the practical application of e-commerce concepts, modern web development practices, and DevOps principles as taught in EWA408510.
